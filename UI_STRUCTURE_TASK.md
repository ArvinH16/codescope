# 🧩 Intern Design Assignment — App Structure (3-Day Sprint)

**Goal:**  
Create a complete **visual structure** of the application (https://v0-mock-pod-projects.vercel.app/) using **Miro**, **Lucidchart**, or **Figma**.  
This should help us finalize how components, pages, and workflows connect before development begins.

---

## 🎯 Tasks

1. **Map Out Structure**
   - Show all main **pages, components, and navigation flows**.  
   - Include sections for **dashboard, user flow, authentication, and integrations**.

2. **Define Data Flow**
   - How data moves between components (frontend ↔ backend).  
   - Note where APIs or external services (like Supabase, Vercel, or MCP servers) may be used.

3. **Collaborate & Iterate**
   - Work as a team — use comments, color codes, and labels to organize feedback.  
   - Each intern should contribute clearly identifiable work.

4. **Leverage v0.dev**
   - Explore **[v0.dev](https://v0.dev)** for quick UI prototypes or mock components.  
   - Note what could be auto-generated there and how it fits into the structure.

## 🗓️ Timeline

- **Day 1:** Research and explore existing UI flows.  
- **Day 2:** Build first draft of structure diagram.  
- **Day 3:** Refine, finalize, and post the link in `#interns` channel (or Notion board).

---

### ✅ Deliverable

Submit a link to your Miro/Lucidchart/Figma board by **end of Day 3**.  
Name the file:  
`AppStructure_<YourName>.pdf` (export your final board as PDF for review).

**Reminder:** Keep it clear, logical, and visually clean — this will become our reference for UI/UX and dev planning.
